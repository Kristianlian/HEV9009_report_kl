**Background**

The data in this repository were collected in the "ReLiEf" study. In this study, we recruited young (<30yrs)
and old (>70yrs) untrained individuals that exercised one leg and arm with a low training volume (low, 1set) 
and the other leg and arm with a moderate training volume (mod, 3sets). The main aim was to investigate the
response to different training volumes between young and old, since the data on the topic is equivocal
at best [SOURCES]. In short, multiple studies find reduced responses to resistance training (RT) in terms
of muscle mass and/or -strength, presumably due to anabolic resistance in the old [SOURCES]. However, 
variations in RT responses seem apparent in both young and old [SOURCES], and therefore it is not clear
whether age *per se* is a direct contributor to reduced RT adaptations or not. The primary outcomes of the
present study were changes in upper- and lower body muscle mass and strength, gathered at baseline,
after ~6 weeks of RT (12/24 sessions), and after ~12 weeks of RT. To characterise these changes, or the 
lack thereof, biological samples (muscle biopsies and blood draws) were taken at baseline, after 3 weeks
of RT and after 12 weeks of RT.
