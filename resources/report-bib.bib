	abstract = {The development of sarcopenia in the elderly is associated with many potential factors and/or processes that impair the renovation and maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and strength as ageing progresses. Among them, a defect by skeletal muscle to respond to anabolic stimuli is to be considered. Common anabolic stimuli/signals in skeletal muscle are hormones (insulin, growth hormones, IGF-1, androgens, and β-agonists such epinephrine), substrates (amino acids such as protein precursors on top, but also glucose and fat, as source of energy), metabolites (such as β-agonists and HMB), various biochemical/intracellular mediators), physical exercise, neurogenic and immune-modulating factors, etc. Each of them may exhibit a reduced effect upon skeletal muscle in ageing. In this article, we overview the role of anabolic signals on muscle metabolism, as well as currently available evidence of resistance, at the skeletal muscle level, to anabolic factors, from both in vitro and in vivo studies. Some indications on how to augment the effects of anabolic signals on skeletal muscle are provided.},

Eight subjects participated in 2 trials. In one (PAAC), they ingested 77.4 g CHO, 17.5 g whey protein, and 4.9 g AA 1 hr after resistance exercise. In the other (CON), 100 g CHO was ingested instead.

The net protein balance response to the mixture consisted of two components, one rapid immediate response, and a smaller delayed response about 90 min after drink, whereas in CON only a small delayed response was seen. We conclude that after resistance exercise, a mixture of whey protein, AA, and CHO stimulated muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than isoenergetic CHO alone. Further, compared to previously reported findings, the addition of protein to an AA + CHO mixture seems to extend the anabolic effect.},

	abstract = {Direct sampling of human skeletal muscle using the needle biopsy technique can facilitate insight into the biochemical and histological responses resulting from changes in exercise or feeding. However, the muscle biopsy procedure is invasive, and analyses are often expensive, which places pragmatic restraints on sample sizes. The unilateral exercise model can serve to increase statistical power and reduce the time and cost of a study. With this approach, 2 limbs of a participant are randomized to 1 of 2 treatments that can be applied almost concurrently or sequentially depending on the nature of the intervention. Similar to a typical repeated measures design, comparisons are made within participants, which increases statistical power by reducing the amount of between-person variability. A washout period is often unnecessary, reducing the time needed to complete the experiment and the influence of potential confounding variables such as habitual diet, activity, and sleep. Variations of the unilateral exercise model have been employed to investigate the influence of exercise, diet, and the interaction between the 2, on a wide range of variables including mitochondrial content, capillary density, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Like any model, unilateral exercise has some limitations: it cannot be used to study variables that potentially transfer across limbs, and it is generally limited to exercises that can be performed in pairs of treatments. Where appropriate, however, the unilateral exercise model can yield robust, well-controlled investigations of skeletal muscle responses to a wide range of interventions and conditions including exercise, dietary manipulation, and disuse or immobilization.},

However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.},

	abstract = {Protein synthesis is deemed the underpinning mechanism enhancing protein balance required for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to resistance exercise. The current model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by resistance training states that the acute increase in the rates of protein synthesis after each bout of resistance exercise is the basis for muscle growth. Within this paradigm, each resistance exercise session would add a specific amount of muscle mass; therefore, muscle hypertrophy could be defined as the result of intermittent and short-lived increases in muscle protein synthesis rates following each resistance exercise session. Although a substantial amount of data has accumulated in the last decades regarding the acute changes in protein synthesis (or translational efficiency) following resistance exercise, considerable gaps on the mechanism of muscle growth still exist. Ribosome biogenesis and translational capacity have emerged as important mediators of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Recent advances in the field have demonstrated that skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with markers of translational capacity and long-term changes in protein synthesis under resting conditions. This review will discuss the caveats of the current model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by resistance training while proposing a working model that takes into consideration the novel data generated by independent laboratories utilizing different methodologies. It is argued, herein, that the role of protein synthesis in the current model of muscle hypertrophy warrants revisiting.},

We demonstrate that depletion of the transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF) leads to the stable and reversible methylation-independent silencing of rRNA genes by promoting histone H1–induced assembly of transcriptionally inactive chromatin. Chromatin remodeling is abrogated by the mutation of an extracellular signal-regulated kinase site within the high mobility group box 1 domain of UBF1, which is required for its ability to bend and loop DNA in vitro. Surprisingly, rRNA gene silencing does not reduce net rRNA synthesis as transcription from remaining active genes is increased. We also show that the active rRNA gene pool is not static but decreases during differentiation, correlating with diminished UBF expression. Thus, UBF1 levels regulate active rRNA gene chromatin during growth and differentiation.},

          , 
            High-intensity muscle contractions (HiMCs) are known to increase c-Myc expression that is known to stimulate ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in most cells. However, although c-Myc mRNA transcription and c-Myc mRNA translation have been shown to be upregulated following resistance exercise concomitantly with increased ribosome biogenesis, this connection has not been tested directly. We investigated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated c-Myc overexpression, with or without fasting or percutaneous electrical stimulation-induced HiMC, on ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in adult mouse skeletal muscles. AAV-mediated overexpression of c-Myc in mouse skeletal muscles for 2 wk increased the DNA polymerase subunit POL1 mRNA, 45S-pre-rRNA, total RNA, and muscle protein synthesis without altering mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling under both ad libitum and fasted conditions. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses revealed that c-Myc overexpression mainly regulated ribosome biogenesis-related biological processes. The protein synthesis response to c-Myc overexpression mirrored the response with HiMC. No additional effect of combining c-Myc overexpression and HiMC was observed. Our results suggest that c-Myc overexpression is sufficient to stimulate skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis without activation of mTORC1. Therefore, the HiMC-induced increase in c-Myc may contribute to ribosome biogenesis and increased protein synthesis following HiMC.

However, whether the increase in c-Myc stimulates ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in skeletal muscles remains unknown.

	abstract = {Hypoxia induces a loss of skeletal muscle mass, but the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that hypoxia could impair skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by functional overload (Ov). To test this hypothesis, plantaris muscles were overloaded during 5, 12, and 56 days in female rats exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (5,500 m), and then, we examined the responses of specific signaling pathways involved in protein synthesis (Akt/mTOR) and breakdown (atrogenes). Hypoxia minimized the Ov-induced hypertrophy at days 5 and 12 but did not affect the hypertrophic response measured at day 56. Hypoxia early reduced the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and its downstream targets P70
              S6K
              and rpS6, but it did not affect the phosphorylation levels of Akt and 4E-BP1, in Ov muscles. The role played by specific inhibitors of mTOR, such as AMPK and hypoxia-induced factors (i.e., REDD1 and BNIP-3) was studied. REDD1 protein levels were reduced by overload and were not affected by hypoxia in Ov muscles, whereas AMPK was not activated by hypoxia. Although hypoxia significantly increased BNIP-3 mRNA levels at day 5, protein levels remained unaffected. The mRNA levels of the two atrogenes MURF1 and MAFbx were early increased by hypoxia in Ov muscles. In conclusion, hypoxia induced a transient alteration of muscle growth in this hypertrophic model, at least partly due to a specific impairment of the mTOR/P70
              S6K
              pathway, independently of Akt, by an undefined mechanism, and increased transcript levels for MURF1 and MAFbx that could contribute to stimulate the proteasomal proteolysis.},

	abstract = {The main goal of the present study was to investigate the regulation of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene transcription at the onset of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Mice were subjected to functional overload of the plantaris by bilateral removal of the synergist muscles. Mechanical loading resulted in muscle hypertrophy with an increase in rRNA content. rDNA transcription, as determined by 45S pre-rRNA abundance, paralleled the increase in rRNA content and was consistent with the onset of the hypertrophic response. Increased transcription and protein expression of c-Myc and its downstream polymerase I (Pol I) regulon (POL1RB, TIF-1A, PAF53, TTF1, TAF1C) was also consistent with the increase in rRNA. Similarly, factors involved in rDNA transcription, such as the upstream binding factor and the Williams syndrome transcription factor, were induced by mechanical loading in a corresponding temporal fashion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that these factors, together with Pol I, were enriched at the rDNA promoter. This, in addition to an increase in histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation, demonstrates that mechanical loading regulates rRNA synthesis by inducing a gene expression program consisting of a Pol I regulon, together with accessory factors involved in transcription and chromatin remodeling at the rDNA promoter. Altogether, these data indicate that transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms take place in the regulation of ribosome production at the onset of muscle hypertrophy.},

              Environmental conditions control rRNA transcription. Previously, we found that serum and glucose deprivation induces KDM2A-mediated H3K36me2 demethylation in the rRNA gene (rDNA) promoter and reduces rRNA transcription in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. However, the molecular mechanism and biological significance are still unclear. In the present study, we found that glucose starvation alone induced the KDM2A-dependent reduction of rRNA transcription. The treatment of cells with 2-deoxy-
              d
              -glucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, reduced rRNA transcription and H3K36me2 in the rDNA promoter, both of which were completely dependent on KDM2A in low concentrations of 2-deoxy-
              d
              -glucose, that is, mild starvation conditions. The mild starvation induced these KDM2A activities through AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) but did not affect another AMPK effector of rRNA transcription, TIF-IA. In the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, the mild starvation also reduced rRNA transcription in a KDM2A-dependent manner. We detected KDM2A in breast cancer tissues irrespective of their estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status, including triple-negative cancer tissues. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, mild starvation reduced cell proliferation, and KDM2A knockdown suppressed the reduction of cell proliferation. These results suggest that under mild glucose starvation AMPK induces KDM2A-dependent reduction of rRNA transcription to control cell proliferation.},

Renal cortex from type 1 diabetic rats and type 2 diabetic db/ db mice showed increased phosphorylation of UBF, Erk, and p70S6 kinase coinciding with renal hypertrophy and onset of matrix accumulation. Our data suggest that augmented ribosome biogenesis occurs in an UBF-dependent manner during increased protein synthesis induced by high glucose in the GECs that correlates with UBF activation and renal hypertrophy in rodents with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) senses changes in the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio, switching off energy-consuming processes and switching on catabolic pathways in response to energy depletion. Here, we show that AMPK down-regulates rRNA synthesis under glucose restriction by phosphorylating the RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-associated transcription factor TIF-IA at a single serine residue (Ser-635). Phosphorylation by AMPK impairs the interaction of TIF-IA with the TBP-containing promoter selectivity factor SL1, thereby precluding the assembly of functional transcription initiation complexes. Mutation of Ser-635 compromises down-regulation of Pol I transcription in response to low energy supply, supporting that activation of AMPK adapts rRNA synthesis to nutrient availability and the cellular energy status.},

	abstract = {Resistance exercise training (RT) is the most effective method for increasing skeletal muscle mass in older adults; however, the amount of RT-induced muscle growth is highly variable between individuals. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others suggests ribosome biogenesis may be an important factor regulating RT-induced hypertrophy, and we hypothesized that the extent of hypertrophy is at least partly regulated by the amount of RT-induced ribosome biogenesis. To examine this, 42 older adults underwent 4 wk of RT aimed at inducing hypertrophy of the knee extensors (e.g., 2 sets of squat, leg press, and knee extension, 10–12 repetition maximums, 3 days/wk), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed pre- and post-RT. Post hoc K-means cluster analysis revealed distinct differences in type II myofiber hypertrophy among subjects. The percent change in type II myofiber size in nonresponders (Non; n = 17) was −7\%, moderate responders (Mod; n = 19) +22\%, and extreme responders (Xtr; n = 6) +83\%. Total muscle RNA increased only in Mod (+9\%, P {\textless} 0.08) and Xtr (+26\%, P {\textless} 0.01), and only Xtr increased rRNA content (+40\%, P {\textless} 0.05) and myonuclei/type II fiber (+32\%, P {\textless} 0.01). Additionally, Mod and Xtr had a greater increase in c-Myc protein levels compared with Non (e.g., approximately +350 and +250\% vs. +50\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05). In vitro studies showed that growth factor-induced human myotube hypertrophy is abolished when rRNA synthesis is knocked down using the Pol I-specific inhibitor CX-5461. Overall, these data implicate ribosome biogenesis as a key process regulating the extent of RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy in older adults.},

It has long been clear that skeletal muscle hypertrophy can be prevented by inhibiting RNA synthesis. Since 80\% of the cell’s total RNA has been estimated to be rRNA, this finding indicates that de novo production of rRNA via transcription of the corresponding genes is important for such hypertrophy to occur. Transcription of rDNA by RNA Pol I is the rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, indicating in turn that this biogenesis strongly influences the hypertrophic response. The present minireview focuses on 1) a brief description of the key steps in ribosome biogenesis and the relationship of this process to skeletal muscle mass and 2) the coordination of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis for growth or atrophy, as exemplified by the intracellular AMPK and mTOR pathways.},

Two-phase break point analysis was used to determine the relationship between total protein intake and changes in fat-free mass (FFM).Results Data from 49 studies with 1863 participants showed that dietary protein supplementation significantly (all p\&lt;0.05) increased changes (means (95\% CI)) in: strength—one-repetition-maximum (2.49 kg (0.64, 4.33)), FFM (0.30 kg (0.09, 0.52)) and muscle size—muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA; 310 µm2 (51, 570)) and mid-femur CSA (7.2 mm2 (0.20, 14.30)) during periods of prolonged RET. The impact of protein supplementation on gains in FFM was reduced with increasing age (−0.01 kg (−0.02,–0.00), p=0.002) and was more effective in resistance-trained individuals (0.75 kg (0.09, 1.40), p=0.03). Protein supplementation beyond total protein intakes of 1.62 g/kg/day resulted in no further RET-induced gains in FFM.Summary/conclusion Dietary protein supplementation significantly enhanced changes in muscle strength and size during prolonged RET in healthy adults. Increasing age reduces and training experience increases the efficacy of protein supplementation during RET. With protein supplementation, protein intakes at amounts greater than {\textasciitilde}1.6 g/kg/day do not further contribute RET-induced gains in FFM.},

In prior work, we noted differences among clusters in the prevalence of myogenic stem cells prior to and during RT ( 35 ), and in the translational signaling responses to the first bout of resistance exercise ( 30 ). Here we identified remarkable differences in the pretraining transcript profiles among clusters (8,026 gene transcripts differentially expressed between Xtr and Non, 2,463 between Xtr and Mod, and 1,294 between Mod and Non). Annotated functions and networks of differentially expressed genes suggest Xtr were “primed” to respond to RT through transcriptional regulation, along with a uniquely expressed network of genes involved in skeletal muscle development, while the failed response in Non may have been driven by excessive proinflammatory signaling. Protein follow-up analysis revealed higher basal levels of acetylated histone H3 (K36) in the two responder clusters (Mod, Xtr) compared with Non, and only the responders experienced alterations in the muscle content of select proteins (e.g., α-tubulin, p27
              kip
              ) in response to the first resistance exercise stimulus. Overall, the widely disparate transcriptomes identified prior to RT among the three clusters support the notion that at least some of the interindividual heterogeneity in propensity for RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy is likely predetermined.},

	abstract = {The effects of strength conditioning on skeletal muscle function and mass were determined in older men. Twelve healthy untrained volunteers (age range 60-72 yr) participated in a 12-wk strength training program (8 repetitions/set; 3 sets/day; 3 days/wk) at 80\% of the one repetition maximum (1 RM) for extensors and flexors of both knee joints. They were evaluated before the program and after 6 and 12 wk of training. Weekly measurements of 1 RM showed a progressive increase in strength in extensors and flexors. By 12 wk extensor and flexor strength had increased 107.4 (P less than 0.0001) and 226.7\% (P less than 0.0001), respectively. Isokinetic peak torque of extensors and flexors measured on a Cybex II dynamometer increased 10.0 and 18.5\% (P less than 0.05) at 60 degrees/s and 16.7 and 14.7\% (P less than 0.05) at 240 degrees/s. The torque-velocity relationship showed an upward displacement of the curve at the end of training, mainly in the slow-velocity high-torque region. Midthigh composition from computerized tomographic scans showed an increase (P less than 0.01) in total thigh area (4.8\%), total muscle area (11.4\%), and quadriceps area (9.3\%). Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle revealed similar increases (P less than 0.001) in type I fiber area (33.5\%) and type II fiber area (27.6\%). Daily excretion of urinary 3-methyl-L-histidine increased with training (P less than 0.05) by an average 40.8\%. Strength gains in older men were associated with significant muscle hypertrophy and an increase in myofibrillar protein turnover.},

Age-related muscle fiber atrophy, seen before training, was diminished after the training period because of an increase in fiber size in older subjects. Muscular strength values, however, were lower with increasing age before and after training, indicating that strength decline in old age is not primarily due to muscle fiber atrophy.},

Men had significantly ( P {\textless} 0.001) more SM in comparison to women in both absolute terms (33.0 vs. 21.0 kg) and relative to body mass (38.4 vs. 30.6\%). The gender differences were greater in the upper (40\%) than lower (33\%) body ( P {\textless} 0.01). We observed a reduction in relative SM mass starting in the third decade; however, a noticeable decrease in absolute SM mass was not observed until the end of the fifth decade. This decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in lower body SM. Weight and height explained ∼50\% of the variance in SM mass in men and women. Although a linear relationship existed between SM and height, the relationship between SM and body weight was curvilinear because the contribution of SM to weight gain decreased with increasing body weight. These findings indicate that men have more SM than women and that these gender differences are greater in the upper body. Independent of gender, aging is associated with a decrease in SM mass that is explained, in large measure, by a decrease in lower body SM occurring after the fifth decade.},

Our aim was to compare the effects of supplementation of native whey, high in leucine, with milk on gains in muscle mass and strength during a period of strength training, in elderly individuals. Methods: In this double-blinded, randomized, controlled study, a total of 30 healthy men and women received two daily servings of 20 g of either milk protein or native whey, during an 11-week strength training intervention. Muscle strength, lean mass, m. vastus lateralis thickness, muscle fiber area, and resting and post-exercise phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1, and eEF-2 were assessed prior to and after the intervention period. Results: Muscle mass and strength increased, by all measures applied in both groups (p {\textless} 0.001), with no differences between groups (p {\textgreater} 0.25). p70S6K phosphorylation increased ({\textasciitilde}1000\%, p {\textless} 0.045) 2 h after exercise in the untrained and trained state, with no differences between supplements.

            Sarcopenia is a skeletal muscle disorder that commonly occurs with advancing age as well as with a number of long-term conditions. Recognition in clinical practice is relatively recent but important because of the association between sarcopenia and a range of adverse effects on health including impaired mobility, increased morbidity and mortality. Originally characterised as loss of muscle mass, the definition has evolved to focus on loss of skeletal muscle function, particularly strength, through a number of international definitions such as that of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People most recently revised in 2019. Progress in the decades ahead is likely to be seen with regard to use of routine health data, prescription of resistance exercise, translation of biology and epidemiology into first in man studies for new treatments, and focus on sarcopenia in low and middle-income countries. Immediate next steps include the newly formed Global Leadership Initiative on Sarcopenia to develop international consensus on definition and diagnosis.},

	abstract = {The hypertrophic response to resistance training is generally attenuated with aging; yet the mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are largely unknown. Several studies to date have shown blunted translational efficiency following acute resistance exercise in older adults; however, the effects on translational capacity (i.e., ribosome biogenesis) have not yet been examined. Thus the purpose of this study was to examine changes in markers of ribosome biogenesis following an acute bout of resistance loading (RL; 9 sets × 10 repetitions of knee extensions) in younger (Y; n = 14; 39.2 ± 4.1 yr) and older (O; n = 12; 75.7 ± 5.7 yr) adults. Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken pre- and 24 h post-RL, and muscle samples were analyzed for total RNA content, 45S pre-rRNA expression, ribosomal protein content, and levels of signaling proteins that regulate ribosome biogenesis. Before RL, O had higher total RNA content (+28\%; P {\textless} 0.05), a trend toward higher 45S pre-rRNA expression (+59\%; P = 0.08), and greater protein content of several ribosomal components (≈ +50–80\%; P {\textless} 0.05) than Y. However, 24 h post-RL, only Y increased 45S pre-rRNA expression (+34\%; P {\textless} 0.01), possibly driven by higher basal p-Rb (Ser780) (+61\%; P = 0.10), and a robust transcription initiation factor (TIF)-1a response (+75\%; P {\textless} 0.05). RL tended to increase protein components of the 40S ribosomal subunit in Y only (≈ +20–25\%; P ≤ 0.12). Overall, the data suggest blunted ribosome biogenesis in response to RL in O, which may be a potential mechanism driving the age-related attenuation of resistance training-induced hypertrophy.},

	abstract = {The ability of skeletal muscle to hypertrophy in response to a growth stimulus is known to be compromised in older individuals. We hypothesized that a change in the expression of protein-encoding genes in response to a hypertrophic stimulus contributes to the blunted hypertrophy observed with aging. To test this hypothesis, we determined gene expression by microarray analysis of plantaris muscle from 5- and 25-mo-old mice subjected to 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days of synergist ablation to induce hypertrophy. Overall, 1,607 genes were identified as being differentially expressed across the time course between young and old groups; however, the difference in gene expression was modest, with cluster analysis showing a similar pattern of expression between the two groups. Despite ribosome protein gene expression being higher in the aged group, ribosome biogenesis was significantly blunted in the skeletal muscle of aged mice compared with mice young in response to the hypertrophic stimulus (50\% vs. 2.5-fold, respectively). The failure to upregulate pre-47S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expression in muscle undergoing hypertrophy of old mice indicated that rDNA transcription by RNA polymerase I was impaired. Contrary to our hypothesis, the findings of the study suggest that impaired ribosome biogenesis was a primary factor underlying the blunted hypertrophic response observed in skeletal muscle of old mice rather than dramatic differences in the expression of protein-encoding genes. The diminished increase in total RNA, pre-47S rRNA, and 28S rRNA expression in aged muscle suggest that the primary dysfunction in ribosome biogenesis occurs at the level of rRNA transcription and processing.},

Recently, the prevalence of sarcopenia increased considerably, posing a serious threat to health worldwide. However, no clear international consensus has been reached regarding the etiology of sarcopenia. Several studies have shown that insulin resistance may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of induced muscle attenuation and that, conversely, sarcopenia can lead to insulin resistance. However, the causal relationship between the two is not clear. In this paper, the pathogenesis of sarcopenia is analyzed, the possible intrinsic causal relationship between sarcopenia and insulin resistance examined, and research progress expounded to provide a basis for the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and study of the mechanism of sarcopenia.},

	abstract = {Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is the driving force behind adaptive responses to exercise and represents a widely adopted proxy for gauging chronic efficacy of acute interventions, (i.e. exercise/nutrition). Recent findings in this arena have been progressive. Nutrient-driven increases in MPS are of finite duration (∼1.5 h), switching off thereafter despite sustained amino acid availability and intramuscular anabolic signalling. Intriguingly, this 'muscle-full set-point' is delayed by resistance exercise (RE) (i.e. the feeding × exercise combination is 'more anabolic' than nutrition alone) even 24 h beyond a single exercise bout, casting doubt on the importance of nutrient timing vs. sufficiency per se. Studies manipulating exercise intensity/workload have shown that increases in MPS are negligible with RE at 20-40\% but maximal at 70-90\% of one-repetition maximum when workload is matched (according to load × repetition number). However, low-intensity exercise performed to failure equalises this response. Analysing distinct subcellular fractions (e.g. myofibrillar, sarcoplasmic, mitochondrial) may provide a readout of chronic exercise efficacy in addition to effect size in MPS per se, i.e. while 'mixed' MPS increases similarly with endurance and RE, increases in myofibrillar MPS are specific to RE, prophetic of adaptation (i.e. hypertrophy). Finally, the molecular regulation of MPS by exercise and its regulation via 'anabolic' hormones (e.g. IGF-1) has been questioned, leading to discovery of alternative mechanosensing-signalling to MPS.},

It has been suggested that an impaired capacity to increase muscle protein synthesis rates in response to protein intake is a key contributor to sarcopenia. We assessed whether differences in post-absorptive and/or post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates exist between large cohorts of healthy young and older men.
PROCEDURES: We performed a cross-sectional, retrospective study comparing in vivo post-absorptive muscle protein synthesis rates determined with stable isotope methodologies between 34 healthy young (22±1 y) and 72 older (75±1 y) men, and post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates between 35 healthy young (22±1 y) and 40 older (74±1 y) men.
FINDINGS: Post-absorptive muscle protein synthesis rates did not differ significantly between the young and older group. Post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates were 16\% lower in the older subjects when compared with the young. Muscle protein synthesis rates were {\textgreater}3 fold more responsive to dietary protein ingestion in the young. Irrespective of age, there was a strong negative correlation between post-absorptive muscle protein synthesis rates and the increase in muscle protein synthesis rate following protein ingestion.
CONCLUSIONS: Aging is associated with the development of muscle anabolic inflexibility which represents a key physiological mechanism underpinning sarcopenia.},

Several studies to date have shown blunted translational efficiency following acute resistance exercise in older adults; however, the effects on translational capacity (i.e., ribosome biogenesis) have not yet been examined. Thus the purpose of this study was to examine changes in markers of ribosome biogenesis following an acute bout of resistance loading (RL; 9 sets × 10 repetitions of knee extensions) in younger (Y; n = 14; 39.2 ± 4.1 yr) and older (O; n = 12; 75.7 ± 5.7 yr) adults. Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken pre- and 24 h post-RL, and muscle samples were analyzed for total RNA content, 45S pre-rRNA expression, ribosomal protein content, and levels of signaling proteins that regulate ribosome biogenesis. Before RL, O had higher total RNA content (+28\%; P {\textless} 0.05), a trend toward higher 45S pre-rRNA expression (+59\%; P = 0.08), and greater protein content of several ribosomal components (≈ +50–80\%; P {\textless} 0.05) than Y. However, 24 h post-RL, only Y increased 45S pre-rRNA expression (+34\%; P {\textless} 0.01), possibly driven by higher basal p-Rb (Ser780) (+61\%; P = 0.10), and a robust transcription initiation factor (TIF)-1a response (+75\%; P {\textless} 0.05). RL tended to increase protein components of the 40S ribosomal subunit in Y only (≈ +20–25\%; P ≤ 0.12). Overall, the data suggest blunted ribosome biogenesis in response to RL in O, which may be a potential mechanism driving the age-related attenuation of resistance training-induced hypertrophy.},

Recent evidence from our laboratory and others suggests ribosome biogenesis may be an important factor regulating RT-induced hypertrophy, and we hypothesized that the extent of hypertrophy is at least partly regulated by the amount of RT-induced ribosome biogenesis. To examine this, 42 older adults underwent 4 wk of RT aimed at inducing hypertrophy of the knee extensors (e.g., 2 sets of squat, leg press, and knee extension, 10–12 repetition maximums, 3 days/wk), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed pre- and post-RT. Post hoc K-means cluster analysis revealed distinct differences in type II myofiber hypertrophy among subjects. The percent change in type II myofiber size in nonresponders (Non; n = 17) was −7\%, moderate responders (Mod; n = 19) +22\%, and extreme responders (Xtr; n = 6) +83\%. Total muscle RNA increased only in Mod (+9\%, P {\textless} 0.08) and Xtr (+26\%, P {\textless} 0.01), and only Xtr increased rRNA content (+40\%, P {\textless} 0.05) and myonuclei/type II fiber (+32\%, P {\textless} 0.01). Additionally, Mod and Xtr had a greater increase in c-Myc protein levels compared with Non (e.g., approximately +350 and +250\% vs. +50\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05). In vitro studies showed that growth factor-induced human myotube hypertrophy is abolished when rRNA synthesis is knocked down using the Pol I-specific inhibitor CX-5461. Overall, these data implicate ribosome biogenesis as a key process regulating the extent of RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy in older adults.},

              Combining endurance training with resistance training (RT) may attenuate skeletal muscle hypertrophic adaptation versus RT alone; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We investigated changes in markers of ribosome biogenesis, a process linked with skeletal muscle hypertrophy, following concurrent training versus RT alone. Twenty-three males underwent eight weeks of RT, either performed alone (RT group,
              n
               = 8), or combined with either high-intensity interval training (HIT+RT group,
              n
               = 8), or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT+RT group,
              n
               = 7). Muscle samples (
              vastus lateralis)
              were obtained before training, and immediately before, 1 h and 3 h after the final training session. Training-induced changes in basal expression of the 45S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor (45S pre-rRNA), and 5.8S and 28S mature rRNAs, were greater with concurrent training versus RT. However, during the final training session, RT further increased both mTORC1 (p70S6K1 and rps6 phosphorylation) and 45S pre-rRNA transcription-related signalling (TIF-1A and UBF phosphorylation) versus concurrent training. These data suggest that when performed in a training-accustomed state, RT induces further increases mTORC1 and ribosome biogenesis-related signalling in human skeletal muscle versus concurrent training; however, changes in ribosome biogenesis markers were more favourable following a period of short-term concurrent training versus RT performed alone.},

                 = 18, 22.0 (1.3) years) performed moderate‐ (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low‐volume (1 set, LOW) resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12 weeks (2–3 sessions per week). Muscle cross‐sectional area (CSA) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0 and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were also sampled before and 1 h after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)\%
                versus
                3.7 (3.7)\%,
                P

                P
                 {\textless} 0.05. This coincided with greater reductions in type IIX fibres from Week 0 to Week 12 (MOD, −4.6 percentage points; LOW −3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6‐kinase 1 (p85 S6K1
                Thr412

                (37\%), greater rested‐state total RNA (8.8\%) and greater exercise‐induced c‐Myc mRNA expression (25\%; Week 2, all
                P
                 {\textless} 0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants, respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to MOD on muscle hypertrophy and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at Week 2 in the MOD leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of MOD benefit by 7.0\% (
                P
                 = 0.005) and 9.8\% (
                P
                 = 0.002). In conclusion, MOD led to greater functional and biological adaptations than LOW. Associations between dose‐dependent total RNA accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose‐dependent training responses.

Type II fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) increased with both AE + RE (22\%) and RE (16\%), while type I fiber CSA increased mainly with AE + RE (16\%). The change score tended to differ between legs for type I CSA ( P = 0.099), and the increase in smallest fiber diameter was greater in AE + RE than RE ( P = 0.029). The number of nuclei per fiber increased after AE + RE in both fiber types, and this increase was greater ( P = 0.027) than after RE. A strong correlation was observed between changes in number of nuclei per fiber and fiber CSA in both fiber types, for both AE + RE and RE ( r {\textgreater} 0.8, P {\textless} 0.004). RNA content increased after AE + RE (24\%, P = 0.019), but the change-scores did not differ across legs. The capillary variables generally increased in both fiber types, with no difference across legs. In conclusion, the accentuated hypertrophic response to AE + RE was associated with more pronounced myonuclear accretion, which was strongly correlated with the degree of fiber hypertrophy. This suggests that myonuclear accretion could play a role in facilitating muscle hypertrophy also during very short training periods.},

              Ribosomes are essential cellular machinery for protein synthesis. It is hypothesised that ribosome content supports muscle growth and that individuals with more ribosomes have greater increases in muscle size following resistance training (RT). Aerobic conditioning (AC) also elicits distinct physiological adaptations; however, no measures of ribosome content following AC have been conducted. We used ribosome‐related gene expression as a proxy measure for ribosome content and hypothesised that AC and RT would increase ribosome‐related gene expression. Fourteen young men and women performed 6 weeks of single‐legged AC followed by 10 weeks of double‐legged RT. Muscle biopsies were taken following AC and following RT in the aerobically conditioned (AC+RT) and unconditioned (RT) legs. No differences in regulatory genes (

When divided for change in leg‐lean soft tissue mass (ΔLLSTM) following RT, legs with the greatest ΔLLSTM had lower expression in 11/13 measured ribosome‐related genes before RT and decreased expression in 9/13 genes following RT. These results indicate that AC and RT did not increase ribosome‐related gene expression. Contrary to previous research, the greatest increase in muscle mass was associated with lower changes in ribosome‐related gene expression over the course of the 10‐week training programme. This may point to the importance of translational efficiency rather than translational capacity (i.e. ribosome content) in mediating long‐term exercise‐induced adaptations in skeletal muscle.},

          , 
            Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copies exist across multiple chromosomes, and interindividual variation in copy number is speculated to influence the hypertrophic response to resistance training. Thus, we examined if rDNA copy number was associated with resistance training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Participants ( n = 53 male, 21 ± 1 yr old; n = 29 female, 21 ± 2 yr old) performed 10–12 wk of full-body resistance training. Hypertrophy outcomes were determined, as was relative rDNA copy number from preintervention vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies. Pre- and postintervention VL biopsy total RNA was assayed in all participants, and mRNA/rRNA markers of ribosome content and biogenesis were also assayed in the 29 female participants before training, 24 h following training bout 1, and in the basal state after 10 wk of training. Across all participants, no significant associations were evident between relative rDNA copy number and training-induced changes in whole body lean mass ( r = −0.034, P = 0.764), vastus lateralis thickness ( r = 0.093, P = 0.408), mean myofiber cross-sectional area ( r = −0.128, P = 0.259), or changes in muscle RNA concentrations ( r = 0.026, P = 0.818), and these trends were similar when examining each gender. However, all Pol-I regulon mRNAs as well as 45S pre-rRNA, 28S rRNA, and 18S rRNA increased 24 h following the first training bout in female participants. Follow-up studies using LHCN-M2 myotubes demonstrated that a reduction in relative rDNA copy number induced by bisphenol A did not significantly affect insulin-like-growth factor-induced myotube hypertrophy. These findings suggest that relative rDNA copy number is not associated with myofiber hypertrophy.

              Abstract
              
                Ageing is associated with impaired hypertrophic responses to resistance exercise training (RET). Here we investigated the aetiology of ‘anabolic resistance’ in older humans. Twenty healthy male individuals, 10 younger (Y; 23 ± 1 years) and 10 older (O; 69 ± 3 years), performed 6 weeks unilateral RET (6 × 8 repetitions, 75\% of one repetition maximum (1‐RM), 3 times per week). After baseline bilateral vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies, subjects consumed 150 ml D
                2
                O (70 atom\%; thereafter 50 ml week
                −1
                ), further bilateral VL muscle biopsies were taken at 3 and 6 weeks to quantify muscle protein synthesis (MPS) via gas chromatography–pyrolysis–isotope ratio mass spectrometry. After RET, 1‐RM increased in Y (+35 ± 4\%) and O (+25 ± 3\%;
                P
                 {\textless} 0.01), while MVC increased in Y (+21 ± 5\%;
                P
                 {\textless} 0.01) but not O (+6 ± 3\%; not significant (NS)). In comparison to Y, O displayed blunted RET‐induced increases in muscle thickness (at 3 and 6 weeks, respectively, Y: +8 ± 1\% and +11 ± 2\%,
                P
                 {\textless} 0.01; O: +2.6 ± 1\% and +3.5 ± 2\%, NS). While ‘basal’ longer term MPS was identical between Y and O (∼1.35 ± 0.1\% day
                −1
                ), MPS increased in response to RET only in Y (3 weeks, Y: 1.61 ± 0.1\% day
                −1
                ; O: 1.49 ± 0.1\% day
                −1
                ). Consistent with this, O exhibited inferior ribosomal biogenesis (RNA:DNA ratio and c‐MYC induction: Y: +4 ± 2 fold change; O: +1.9 ± 1 fold change), translational efficiency (S6K1 phosphorylation, Y: +10 ± 4 fold change; O: +4 ± 2 fold change) and anabolic hormone milieu (testosterone, Y: 367 ± 19; O: 274 ± 19 ng dl

                P

The role of ribosome biogenesis in supporting the increased muscle protein synthetic demands is not known. This study examined the effect of both a single acute bout of resistance exercise (RE) and a chronic RT program on the muscle ribosome biogenesis response. Fourteen healthy young men performed a single bout of RE both before and after 8 wk of chronic RT. Muscle cross-sectional area was increased by 6 ± 4.5\% in response to 8 wk of RT. Acute RE-induced activation of the ERK and mTOR pathways were similar before and after RT, as assessed by phosphorylation of ERK, MNK1, p70S6K, and S6 ribosomal protein 1 h postexercise. Phosphorylation of TIF-IA was also similarly elevated following both RE sessions. Cyclin D1 protein levels, which appeared to be regulated at the translational rather than transcriptional level, were acutely increased after RE. UBF was the only protein found to be highly phosphorylated at rest after 8 wk of training. Also, muscle levels of the rRNAs, including the precursor 45S and the mature transcripts (28S, 18S, and 5.8S), were increased in response to RT.

              Background
              Translational capacity (i.e. ribosomal mass) is a key determinant of protein synthesis and has been associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The role of translational capacity in muscle atrophy and regrowth from disuse is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effect of muscle disuse and reloading on translational capacity in middle‐aged men (Study 1) and in rats (Study 2).
            
            
              Methods
              
                In Study 1, 28 male participants (age 50.03 ± 3.54 years) underwent 2 weeks of knee immobilization followed by 2 weeks of ambulatory recovery and a further 2 weeks of resistance training. Muscle biopsies were obtained for measurement of total RNA and pre‐ribosomal (r)RNA expression, and
                vastus lateralis
                cross‐sectional area (CSA) was determined via peripheral quantitative computed tomography. In Study 2, male rats underwent hindlimb suspension (HS) for either 24 h (HS 24 h,
                n
                 = 4) or 7 days (HS 7d,
                n
                 = 5), HS for 7 days followed by 7 days of reloading (Rel,
                n
                 = 5) or remained as ambulatory weight bearing (WB,
                n
                 = 5) controls. Rats received deuterium oxide throughout the study to determine RNA synthesis and degradation, and mTORC1 signalling pathway was assessed.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Two weeks of immobilization reduced total RNA concentration (20\%) and CSA (4\%) in men (both
                P
                 ≤ 0.05). Ambulatory recovery restored total RNA concentration to baseline levels and partially restored muscle CSA. Total RNA concentration and 47S pre‐rRNA expression increased above basal levels after resistance training (
                P
                 ≤ 0.05). In rats, RNA synthesis was 30\% lower while degradation was {\textasciitilde}400\% higher in HS 7d in soleus and plantaris muscles compared with WB (
                P
                 ≤ 0.05). mTORC1 signalling was lower in HS compared with WB as was 47S pre‐rRNA (
                P
                 ≤ 0.05). With reloading, the aforementioned parameters were restored to WB levels while RNA degradation was suppressed (
                P
                 ≤ 0.05).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Changes in RNA concentration following muscle disuse and reloading were associated with changes in ribosome biogenesis and degradation, indicating that both processes are important determinants of translational capacity. The pre‐clinical data help explain the reduced translational capacity after muscle immobilization in humans and demonstrate that ribosome biogenesis and degradation might be valuable therapeutic targets to maintain muscle mass during disuse.},

              Purpose
              Resistance training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy seems to depend on ribosome biogenesis and content. High glucose treatment may augment ribosome biogenesis through potentiating resistance training-induced adaptations. This was investigated with total RNA and ribosomal RNA abundances as main outcomes, with relevant transcriptional/translational regulators (c-Myc/UBF/rpS6) as a secondary outcome.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Sixteen healthy, moderately trained individuals [male/female,
                n
                 = 9/7; age, 24.1 (3.3)] participated in a within-participant crossover trial with unilateral resistance training (leg press and knee extension, 3 sets of 10 repetitions maximum) and pre- and post-exercise ingestion of either glucose (3 × 30 g, 90 g total) or placebo supplements (Stevia rebaudiana, 3 × 0.3 g, 0.9 g total), together with protein (2 × 25 g, 50 g total), on alternating days for 12 days. Six morning resistance exercise sessions were conducted per condition, and the sessions were performed in an otherwise fasted state. Micro-biopsies were sampled from m. vastus lateralis before and after the intervention.

                Glucose ingestion did not have beneficial effects on resistance training-induced increases of ribosomal content (mean difference 7.6\% [− 7.2, 24.9],

              Background
              Resistance training (RT) and nutritional supplementation are recommended for the management of sarcopenia in older adults. However, optimal RT intensity for the treatment of sarcopenia has not been well investigated.
            
            
              Methods
              This network meta-analysis aims to determine the comparative effectiveness of interventions for sarcopenia, taking RT intensity into consideration. RT intensity was classified into light-to-moderate intensity RT(LMRT), moderate intensity RT(MRT), and moderate-to-vigorous intensity RT(MVRT) based on percentage of one repetition maximum (\%1RM) and/or rating of perceived exertion.
            
            
              Results
              
                A total of 50 RCTs (
                N
                 = 4,085) were included after screening 3,485 articles. The results confirmed that RT with or without nutrition was positively associated with improved measures of muscle strength and physical performance. Regarding RT intensity, LMRT only demonstrated positive effects on hand grip (aerobic training + LMRT + nutrition: mean difference [MD] = 2.88; 95\% credential intervals [CrI] = 0.43,5.32). MRT provided benefits on improvement in the 30-s chair stand test (repetitions) (MRT: MD = 2.98, 95\% CrI = 0.35,5.59), timed up and go test (MRT: MD = -1.74, 95\% CrI: = -3.34,-0.56), hand grip (MRT: MD = 2.44; 95\% CrI = 0.03,5.70), and leg press (MRT: MD = 8.36; 95\% CrI = 1.87,13.4). MVRT also improved chair stand test repetitions (MVRT: MD = 5.64, 95\% CrI = 0.14,11.4), gait speed (MVRT + nutrition: MD = 0.21, 95\% CrI = 0.003,0.48), appendicular skeletal muscle index (MVRT + nutrition: MD = 0.25, 95\% CrI = 0.01,0.5), and leg press (MVRT: MD = 14.7, 95\% CrI: 5.96,22.4; MVRT + nutrition: MD = 17.8, 95\% CrI: 7.55,28.6).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              MVRT had greater benefits on muscle mass, lower extremity strength, and physical performance compared to MRT. Increasing RT intensity may be recommended for sarcopenic older adults.},

            Ribosomes are the macromolecular engines of protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis is stimulated by exercise, but the contribution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number and methylation to exercise-induced rDNA transcription is unclear. To investigate the genetic and epigenetic regulation of ribosome biogenesis with exercise, a time course of skeletal muscle biopsies was obtained from 30 participants (18 men and 12 women; 31 ±8 yrs, 25 ±4 kg/m
            2
            ) at rest and 30 min, 3h, 8h, and 24h after acute endurance (n=10, 45 min cycling, 70\% VO
            2
            max) or resistance exercise (n=10, 4 x 7 x 2 exercises); 10 control participants underwent biopsies without exercise. rDNA transcription and dosage were assessed using qPCR and whole genome sequencing. rDNA promoter methylation was investigated using massARRAY EpiTYPER, and global rDNA CpG methylation was assessed using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. Ribosome biogenesis and
            MYC
            transcription were associated with resistance but not endurance exercise, indicating preferential up-regulation during hypertrophic processes. With resistance exercise, ribosome biogenesis was associated with rDNA gene dosage as well as epigenetic changes in enhancer and non-canonical MYC-associated areas in rDNA, but not the promoter. A mouse model of
            in vivo
            metabolic RNA labeling and genetic myonuclear fluorescent labeling validated the effects of an acute hypertrophic stimulus on ribosome biogenesis and
            Myc
            transcription, and corroborated rDNA enhancer and Myc-associated methylation alterations specifically in myonuclei. This study provides the first information on skeletal muscle genetic and rDNA gene-wide epigenetic regulation of ribosome biogenesis in response to exercise, revealing novel roles for rDNA dosage and CpG methylation.

Here, we aimed to test whether the same was true with acute exercise-mediated changes in muscle protein synthesis. Eighteen men (21 ± 1 yr, 22.6 ± 2.1 kg/m
              2
              ; means ± SE) had their legs randomly assigned to two of three training conditions that differed in contraction intensity [\% of maximal strength (1 repetition maximum)] or contraction volume (1 or 3 sets of repetitions): 30\%-3, 80\%-1, and 80\%-3. Subjects trained each leg with their assigned regime for a period of 10 wk, 3 times/wk. We made pre- and posttraining measures of strength, muscle volume by magnetic resonance (MR) scans, as well as pre- and posttraining biopsies of the vastus lateralis, and a single postexercise (1 h) biopsy following the first bout of exercise, to measure signaling proteins. Training-induced increases in MR-measured muscle volume were significant ( P {\textless} 0.01), with no difference between groups: 30\%-3 = 6.8 ± 1.8\%, 80\%-1 = 3.2 ± 0.8\%, and 80\%-3= 7.2 ± 1.9\%, P = 0.18. Isotonic maximal strength gains were not different between 80\%-1 and 80\%-3, but were greater than 30\%-3 ( P = 0.04), whereas training-induced isometric strength gains were significant but not different between conditions ( P = 0.92). Biopsies taken 1 h following the initial resistance exercise bout showed increased phosphorylation ( P {\textless} 0.05) of p70S6K only in the 80\%-1 and 80\%-3 conditions. There was no correlation between phosphorylation of any signaling protein and hypertrophy.

              J Strength Cond Res
              XX(X): 000–000, 2019—Aging, even in the absence of chronic disease, is associated with a variety of biological changes that can contribute to decreases in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function. Such losses decrease physiologic resilience and increase vulnerability to catastrophic events. As such, strategies for both prevention and treatment are necessary for the health and well-being of older adults. The purpose of this Position Statement is to provide an overview of the current and relevant literature and provide evidence-based recommendations for resistance training for older adults. As presented in this Position Statement, current research has demonstrated that countering muscle disuse through resistance training is a powerful intervention to combat the loss of muscle strength and muscle mass, physiological vulnerability, and their debilitating consequences on physical functioning, mobility, independence, chronic disease management, psychological well-being, quality of life, and healthy life expectancy. This Position Statement provides evidence to support recommendations for successful resistance training in older adults related to 4 parts: (a) program design variables, (b) physiological adaptations, (c) functional benefits, and (d) considerations for frailty, sarcopenia, and other chronic conditions. The goal of this Position Statement is to a) help foster a more unified and holistic approach to resistance training for older adults, b) promote the health and functional benefits of resistance training for older adults, and c) prevent or minimize fears and other barriers to implementation of resistance training programs for older adults.},

            Background
            Lifestyle therapy with resistance training is a potent measure to counteract age-related loss in muscle strength and mass. Unfortunately, many individuals fail to respond in the expected manner. This phenomenon is particularly common among older adults and those chronically diseased (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD), and may involve endocrine variables such as vitamin D. At present, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on responses to resistance training remain largely unexplored.
          
          
            Methods
            
              Ninety-five male and female participants (healthy, n=71; COPD, n=24; age 68 ± 5 years) were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D
              3
              or placebo supplementation for 28 weeks in a double-blinded manner (latitude 61°N, September-May). Seventy-eight participants completed the RCT, which was initiated by 12 weeks of supplementation-only (in average, 3333 IU.day
              -1
              ), followed by 13 weeks of combined supplementation (2000 IU.day
              -1
              ) and supervised whole-body resistance training (twice weekly), interspersed with testing and measurements. Outcome measures included multiple assessments of muscle strength (n=7), endurance performance (n=6), and muscle mass (n=3, legs, primary), as well as muscle quality (legs), muscle biology (
              m. vastus lateralis
              ; muscle fibre characteristics, transcriptome), and health-related variables (e.g. visceral fat mass and blood lipid profile). For main outcome domains such as muscle strength and muscle mass, weighted combined factors were calculated from the range of singular assessments.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              Overall, 13 weeks of resistance training increased muscle strength (13\% ± 8\%), muscle mass (9\% ± 8\%) and endurance performance (one-legged, 23\% ± 15\%; whole-body, 8\% ± 7\%), assessed as weighted combined factors, and were associated with changes in health variables (e.g. visceral fat, − 6\% ± 21\%; [LDL]
              serum
              , −4\% ± 14\%) and muscle tissue characteristics such as fibre type proportions (e.g. IIX, −3\%-points), myonuclei·fibre
              -1
              (30\% ± 65\%), total RNA/rRNA abundances (15\%/6-19\%), and transcriptome profiles (e.g. ∼336 differentially expressed genes). Vitamin D
              3
              supplementation led to robust increases in [25(OH)D]
              serum
              (Δ49\% vs placebo), but did not affect training-associated changes for any of the main outcome domains, with no interaction being evident with disease status or pre-RCT [25(OH)D]
              serum
              . In secondary analyses, vitamin D
              3
              affected expression of gene sets involved in vascular functions in muscle tissue, strength gains in participants with high fat mass, and [cortisol]

              Blood volume (BV) is an important clinical parameter and is usually reported per kg of body mass (BM). When fat mass is elevated, this underestimates BV/BM. One aim was to study if differences in BV/BM related to sex, age, and fitness would decrease if normalized to lean body mass (LBM). The analysis included 263 women and 319 men (age: 10–93 years, body mass index: 14–41 kg/m
              2
              ) and 107 athletes who underwent assessment of BV and hemoglobin mass (Hb
              mass
              ), body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness. BV/BM was 25\% lower (70.3 ± 11.3 and 80.3 ± 10.8 mL/kg
              BM
              ) in women than men, respectively, whereas BV/LBM was 6\% higher in women (110.9 ± 12.5 and 105.3 ± 11.2 mL/kg
              LBM
              ). Hb
              mass
              /BM was 34\% lower (8.9 ± 1.4 and 11.5 ± 11.2 g/kg
              BM
              ) in women than in men, respectively, but only 6\% lower (14.0 ± 1.5 and 14.9 ± 1.5 g/kg
              LBM
              )/LBM. Age did not affect BV. Athlete's BV/BM was 17.2\% higher than non‐athletes, but decreased to only 2.5\% when normalized to LBM. Of the variables analyzed, LBM was the strongest predictor for BV (
              R
              2
               = .72,

Within this age group, cardiovascular disease will remain the leading cause of death, and the cost associated with treatment will continue to increase. Aging is an inevitable part of life and unfortunately poses the largest risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although numerous studies in the cardiovascular field have considered both young and aged humans, there are still many unanswered questions as to how the genetic pathways that regulate aging in model organisms influence cardiovascular aging. Likewise, in the molecular biology of aging field, few studies fully assess the role of these aging pathways in cardiovascular health. Fortunately, this gap is beginning to close, and these two fields are merging together. We provide an overview of some of the key genes involved in regulating lifespan and health span, including sirtuins, AMP-activated protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 and their roles regulating cardiovascular health. We then discuss a series of review articles that will appear in succession and provide a more comprehensive analysis of studies carried out linking genes of aging and cardiovascular health, and perspectives of future directions of these two intimately linked fields.},

Total hemoglobin mass is derived by multiplication with the molar weight of hemoglobin.

              Background
              Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) displays substantial inter-individual genetic variation in human and mouse. A systematic analysis of how this variation impacts epigenetic states and expression of the rDNA has thus far not been performed.
            
            
              Results
              Using a combination of long- and short-read sequencing, we establish that 45S rDNA units in the C57BL/6J mouse strain exist as distinct genetic haplotypes that influence the epigenetic state and transcriptional output of any given unit. DNA methylation dynamics at these haplotypes are dichotomous and life-stage specific: at one haplotype, the DNA methylation state is sensitive to the in utero environment, but refractory to post-weaning influences, whereas other haplotypes entropically gain DNA methylation during aging only. On the other hand, individual rDNA units in human show limited evidence of genetic haplotypes, and hence little discernible correlation between genetic and epigenetic states. However, in both species, adjacent units show similar epigenetic profiles, and the overall epigenetic state at rDNA is strongly positively correlated with the total rDNA copy number. Analysis of different mouse inbred strains reveals that in some strains, such as 129S1/SvImJ, the rDNA copy number is only approximately 150 copies per diploid genome and DNA methylation levels are {\textless} 5\%.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our work demonstrates that rDNA-associated genetic variation has a considerable influence on rDNA epigenetic state and consequently rRNA expression outcomes. In the future, it will be important to consider the impact of inter-individual rDNA (epi)genetic variation on mammalian phenotypes and diseases.},

	abstract = {Anabolic resistance is defined by a blunted stimulation of muscle protein synthesis rates (MPS) to common anabolic stimuli in skeletal muscle tissue such as dietary protein and exercise. Generally, MPS is the target of most exercise and feeding interventions as muscle protein breakdown rates seem to be less responsive to these stimuli. Ultimately, the blunted responsiveness of MPS to dietary protein and exercise underpins the loss of the amount and quality of skeletal muscle mass leading to decrements in physical performance in these populations. The increase of both habitual physical activity (including structured exercise that targets general fitness characteristics) and protein dense food ingestion are frontline strategies utilized to support muscle mass, performance, and health. In this paper, we discuss anabolic resistance as a common denominator underpinning muscle mass loss with aging, obesity, and other disease states. Namely, we discuss the fact that anabolic resistance exists as a dimmer switch, capable of varying from higher to lower levels of resistance, to the main anabolic stimuli of feeding and exercise depending on the population. Moreover, we review the evidence on whether increased physical activity and targeted exercise can be leveraged to restore the sensitivity of skeletal muscle tissue to dietary amino acids regardless of the population.},

These non-Medawarian tissues exhibit high rates of cancer and age-of-expression-associated somatic mutations. In contrast, genes under genetic control are under relaxed constraint. Together, we demonstrate the distinct roles of aging and genetics on expression phenotypes.},

              Exercise training prevents age‐related decline in muscle function. Targeting epigenetic aging is a promising actionable mechanism and late‐life exercise mitigates epigenetic aging in rodent muscle. Whether exercise training can decelerate, or reverse epigenetic aging in humans is unknown. Here, we performed a powerful meta‐analysis of the methylome and transcriptome of an unprecedented number of human skeletal muscle samples (
              n
               = 3176). We show that: (1) individuals with higher baseline aerobic fitness have younger epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles, (2) exercise training leads to significant shifts of epigenetic and transcriptomic patterns toward a younger profile, and (3) muscle disuse “ages” the transcriptome. Higher fitness levels were associated with attenuated differential methylation and transcription during aging. Furthermore, both epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles shifted toward a younger state after exercise training interventions, while the transcriptome shifted toward an older state after forced muscle disuse. We demonstrate that exercise training targets many of the age‐related transcripts and DNA methylation loci to maintain younger methylome and transcriptome profiles, specifically in genes related to muscle structure, metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Our comprehensive analysis will inform future studies aiming to identify the best combination of therapeutics and exercise regimes to optimize longevity.},

	abstract = {Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass leads to a reduction of strength. It is likely due to an inadequate stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in response to anabolic stimuli, such as mechanical load. Ribosome biogenesis is a major determinant of translational capacity and is essential for the control of muscle mass. This mini-review aims to put forth the hypothesis that ribosome biogenesis is impaired by aging in response to mechanical load, which could contribute to the age-related anabolic resistance and progressive muscle atrophy. Recent animal studies indicate that aging impedes muscle hypertrophic response to mechanical overload. This is associated with an impaired transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), a limited increase in total RNA concentration, a blunted activation of AKT/mTOR pathway, and an increased phosphorylation of AMPK. In contrast, an age-mediated impairment of ribosome biogenesis is unlikely in response to electrical stimulations. In human, the hypertrophic response to resistance exercise training is diminished with age. This is accompanied by a deficit in long-term MPS and an absence of increased total RNA concentration. The results addressing the acute response to resistance exercise suggest an impaired Pol I-mediated rDNA transcription and attenuated activation/expression of several upstream regulators of ribosome biogenesis in muscles from aged individuals. Altogether, emerging evidence indicates that impaired ribosome biogenesis could partly explain age-related anabolic resistance to mechanical load, which may ultimately contribute to progressive muscle atrophy. Future research should develop more advanced molecular tools to provide in-depth analysis of muscle ribosome biogenesis.},

	abstract = {The magnitude of muscle hypertrophy in response to resistance training (RT) is highly variable between individuals (response heterogeneity). Manipulations in RT variables may modulate RT-related response heterogeneity; yet, this remains to be determined. Using a within-subject unilateral design, we aimed to investigate the effects of RT volume manipulation on whole-muscle hypertrophy (quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area [qCSA]) among non-responders and responders to a low RT dose (single-set). We also investigated the effects of RT volume manipulation on muscle strength in these responsiveness groups. Eighty-five older individuals (41M/44F, age=68±4 y; BMI=26.4±3.7 kg/m
              2
              ) had one leg randomly allocated to a single (1)-set and the contralateral leg allocated to 4 sets of unilateral knee-extension RT at 8-15 repetition maximum (RM) for 10-wk 2d/wk. Pre- and post-intervention, participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and unilateral knee-extension 1-RM strength testing. MRI typical error (2xTE=3.27\%) was used to classify individuals according to responsiveness patterns. N=51 were classified as non-responders (≤2xTE) and N=34 as responders ({\textgreater}2xTE) based on pre- to post-intervention change qCSA following the single-set RT protocol. Non-responders to single-set training showed a dose-response, with significant time*set interactions for qCSA and 1-RM strength, indicating greater gains in response to the higher volume prescription (time*set: P{\textless}0.05 for both outcomes). Responders improved qCSA (time: P{\textless}0.001), with a tendency towards higher benefit from the 4 sets RT protocol (time*set: P=0.08); on the other hand, 1-RM increased similarly irrespectively of RT volume prescription (time*set: P{\textgreater}0.05). Our findings support the use of higher RT volume to mitigate non-responsiveness among older adults.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle mass, a strong predictor of longevity and health in humans, is determined by the balance of two cellular processes, muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown. MPS seems to be particularly sensitive to changes in mechanical load and/or nutritional status; therefore, much research has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin this cellular process. Furthermore, older individuals display an attenuated MPS response to anabolic stimuli, termed anabolic resistance, which has a negative impact on muscle mass and function, as well as quality of life. Therefore, an understanding of which, if any, molecular mechanisms contribute to anabolic resistance of MPS is of vital importance in formulation of therapeutic interventions for such populations. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the mechanisms that underpin MPS, which are broadly divided into mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent, mTORC1-independent, and ribosomal biogenesis-related, and describes the evidence that shows how they are regulated by anabolic stimuli (exercise and/or nutrition) in healthy human skeletal muscle. This review also summarizes evidence regarding which of these mechanisms may be implicated in age-related skeletal muscle anabolic resistance and provides recommendations for future avenues of research that can expand our knowledge of this area.},

	abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},
